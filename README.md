# WordPress Coding Standards Docs

This repo contains the source for the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/installing-a-local-server/) on https://developer.wordpress.org

When creating new files, these must be added to the [manifest.json](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/docs/blob/master/manifest.json) file. 

Removing files also requires updating the [manifest.json](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/docs/blob/master/manifest.json) file. After deletion and sync with DevHub, the page also needs to be manually deleted from DevHub.
