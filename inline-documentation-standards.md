# Inline Documentation Standards

Inline documentation provides a good resource for core developers in future development, and other developers when learning about WordPress. It also provides the information necessary to populate the <a href="http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/">WordPress developer code reference</a>.

<blockquote>
<strong>I don't need to document my code. I wrote all of it - know it like the back of my hand.</strong>

"I would argue that, separately, documentation <em>is also</em> for you, the developer. I've found quite often that my inline documentation can be a very effective breadcrumb trail when establishing one's own intent, particularly with regard to complex function arguments and usage. And it's also helpful to return to a function two years later and find a paragraph in the inline documentation that describes, in meticulous fashion, something that I otherwise would have had to rediscover all over again." <em>- Nacin</em>
